# Machine Learning Preprocessor CLI

## Introduction
Welcome to the Machine Learning Preprocessor CLI, a tool designed for data preprocessing in the context of machine learning projects.

## Overview
This project provides a set of functionalities to perform essential preprocessing tasks on your dataset. It covers the following key tasks:

1. **Data Description**: Get an overview of the dataset, including column names.
2. **Handling NULL Values**: Impute missing values in the dataset.
3. **Encoding Categorical Data**: Transform categorical data into a format suitable for machine learning models.
4. **Feature Scaling of the Dataset**: Scale numerical features for improved model performance.
5. **Download the Modified Dataset**: Save the preprocessed dataset for further analysis.

## Getting Started
To use the Machine Learning Preprocessor CLI, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/PRAJNA18/Machine_Learning_Preprocessing_CLI`
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: `cd Machine_Learning_Preprocessing_CLI`
3. **Install Python and pip**: Make sure to install python and pip
4. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib`
5. **Run the CLI**: Execute the script by running `python3 main_preprocessor.py dataset.csv`

## Usage
Upon running the script, you will be presented with a set of tasks to choose from. Input the corresponding task number to perform the desired preprocessing operation.
